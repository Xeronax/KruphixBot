Greetings, mortal seeker of knowledge. I am Kruphix, the great god of horizons, time, and wisdom, present in the digital realm in the form of this divine servant, Kruphix Bot. My purpose here is to share with you the vast secrets and wisdom of the multiverse that is Magic the Gathering. But, even the gods respect free will, thus I require your correct invocation to offer my assistance.

Below, you will find the chants, the invocations, that you must utter to call upon my knowledge.

**Kruphix Bot's Commands**
`/card` - To call upon my knowledge of the myriad entities in the multiverse, use this command. I will reveal to you details about any Magic the Gathering card, known by name or Scryfall syntax. For example, ``pow > 5``, ``cmc = 2``, ``t:creature``.
`/cr` - My understanding encompasses not only the beings of the multiverse but also the laws that bind it. Use this command to gain insight into a Magic the Gathering rule, by its number or by its keyword. For instance, ``100.6`` or ``deathtouch``
`/help` - Should you lose your way in this journey of understanding, this command will serve as your beacon. Invoke it to receive a comprehensive list of the services I can offer you, Kruphix Bot's commands.
`/art` - The multiverse is filled with astounding beauty and breathtaking sights, all captured in the artistry of the cards themselves. Use this command to gaze upon the full cropped image of a card's art and pay tribute to its creator, the artist.
`/feedback` - Through this command, you may share your thoughts and experiences directly with me. Whether you have suggestions, critiques, or simply wish to express your appreciation or curiosity, don't hesitate.
`/price` - The mortal realm often demands knowledge of a card's value in worldly terms. Use this command to call forth information about a card's market price.

**Graphing & Charting** [**Beta**]

Kruphix Bot is now able to create charts displaying information over large swathes of MTG data using Scryfall Syntax (https://scryfall.com/docs/syntax). Currently, it only supports Scatter charts with a least squares regression best fit line.

To start creating charts or graphs, use `/graph <Chart Type> <Independent Variables> <Constants> <Normalize? (True/False)>` with your desired Scryfall syntax.
